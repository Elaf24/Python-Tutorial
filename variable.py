# Creating Variables
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)



# Casting
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
#
# Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0


#
# Get the Type
# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
print(type(x))
